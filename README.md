## Adobe-CS-Scripts

A collection of scripts that can be used in Adobe Creative Suite. I do not claim full ownership of all scripts. See comments in files for details.

### Included Scripts
- **create-grid-guide-*.jsx:** Use these plugins to easily create grids with guides. The plugin prompts the user to enter the column width and row height for the grid. Useful for creating CSS sprites.
